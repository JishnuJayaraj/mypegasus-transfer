# Data protection (DSGVO / social data) — engineering rules

> This is an engineering guideline, not legal advice. Have it reviewed by the company's data
> protection officer before go-live.
>
> Status: updated 2026-10-15 from the decisions log. Most answers here are still **`assumed`**
> (rows marked 🔒 in `open-questions.md`). Build on them, but **nothing in this file may be
> `assumed` or `verify` at the pre-pilot gate.** Items marked *(Qnn)* point to the question.

## Roles under the GDPR *(assumed, Q14)*

- The **TG is an independent controller**, also in phase 1. It is neither a processor for the
  customer nor a joint controller.
- The **customer** is a separate controller for its own HR data and for transferring the import
  file to us.
- Consequences:
  - The customer contract needs a **data-sharing clause** (what is transferred, for which
    purpose), not an AVV.
  - The customer cannot order deletion. Deletion follows our retention rules only. There is no
    "customer deletion request" feature.
  - We need an **AVV with every processor**: the cluster operator chain (owned by the product owner, Q32; blocking for the
    pilot), SMS/mail providers, Gotenberg/storage if run by a third party.

## Classification *(assumed, Q29, Q43)*

| Class | Data | Handling |
|---|---|---|
| **Special category** | health restrictions, Schwerbehinderung/Gleichstellung, GdB | field-level encryption; never in list payloads; separate endpoint; every read logged |
| **Highly confidential** | RV/SV-Nummer, Steuer-ID, IBAN, BA-Kundennummer; Bürgergeld (yes/no only, concerns the spouse too); nationality, date of entry, residence status (incl. Duldung); profiling results (TL 407 section C ratings, Gesamteinschätzung, weiteres Vorgehen) | field-level encryption; never in list payloads; every read logged |
| **Confidential** | name, address, contact, date of birth, CV, qualifications, job wishes | role × project access |
| **Internal** | project, dates, statuses | role × project access |
| **Aggregated** | counts, rates per project | may go to the customer, with suppression |

- **Signed documents** (TL 407, Kug 200b, DSV) take the class of their most sensitive content
  and are stored encrypted.
- **TG sub-status periods** (sickness, parental leave) are payroll records: type and dates only,
  never diagnoses, never AU scans (Q51).
- Free text in section C is **never** included in exports.

## Access matrix *(assumed, Q28, Q49, Q51)*

| Data | Profiler/Berater (assigned) | PL (assigned project) | Back office | Regional admin / Admin | Participant |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Confidential data | yes | yes | yes, as needed | no case data | own |
| Health, Schwerbehinderung (structured) | yes | no; except in assisted mode (`onBehalfOf`) or break-glass with reason | Schwerbehinderung/Gleichstellung + GdB only (payroll) | never | own |
| Highly confidential identifiers (RV-Nr., IBAN, Steuer-ID) | as needed for forms | no | yes (payroll) | never | own |
| Nationality, residence status, Bürgergeld | yes | no | yes | never | own |
| Section C ratings, Gesamteinschätzung, weiteres Vorgehen | yes | **no** | no | never | not in the portal |
| Signed TL 407 PDF | yes | yes, opening is an explicit logged action; normal UI shows metadata only | **no** | never | — |
| Signed Kug 200b PDF | yes | yes, logged as above | **no** | never | — |
| Sub-status periods | "abwesend" + dates | "abwesend" + dates | type + dates | never | own |
| Evidence set after exit | break-glass with reason (audits) | break-glass with reason | break-glass with reason | never | — |

- **Break-glass**: mandatory reason, audited, flagged for review.
- **Regional admins and admins manage configuration, not cases.** They see no participant data.
  Escalations to the regional admin (e.g. TL 407 not submitted 14 days after TG start) show
  only: project, responsible PL, number of overdue items per type (e.g. "3 × TL 407 not
  submitted"), and days overdue for the oldest item. **No participant names.** For details the
  regional admin contacts the PL (Q57).
- **Customer**: no login in the MVP (Q47). See the next section.

## Customer reporting *(assumed, Q5, Q13, Q47)*

- **No person-level data to the customer, except a fixed whitelist**: name, Personalnummer,
  DSV signed (yes/no + date), beE entry date, beE exit date. The customer needs these to end
  the old employment relationships and calculate per-head costs and Remanenzkosten. The
  whitelist is enforced in the API/report layer (`customerVisible`), not in the UI.
- Everything else is **aggregated with n < 5 suppressed** ("< 5"), plus **secondary
  suppression** so totals can't be used to back-calculate. The threshold is a global setting
  (default 5), implemented in the reporting layer.
- MVP: the PL generates a **monthly report** (PDF + CSV) and sends it to the customer. A
  customer portal is deferred to v2.
- Withdrawal after `dsv_signed` sets a **customer notification flag** (Q46).

## Legal basis and consent *(assumed, Q4, Q44)*

| Purpose | Legal basis |
|---|---|
| Import from the customer (name, contact, Personalnummer) | Art. 6(1)(f), backed by the Transfersozialplan |
| Information, data collection, DSV preparation | Art. 6(1)(b), pre-contractual |
| beE employment, payroll, Transfer-KuG | Art. 6(1)(b) + (c) (SGB III, SGB IV, AO) |
| Profiling and reporting to the Agentur | Art. 6(1)(c) (§110/§111 SGB III) + signed TL 407 declaration |
| Health / disability | Art. 9(2)(b). Details beyond yes/no only with explicit consent, Art. 9(2)(a) |
| Private email/mobile for portal login | consent, Art. 6(1)(a), revocable |
| TG access to the BA applicant profile (Kug 200b) | own consent record |
| Aggregated customer reporting | Art. 6(1)(f), anonymised |

- Each processing purpose is stored with its legal basis.
- **Our consents** are records: purpose, text version (per language), timestamp, `revokedAt`.
  Revoking consent never blocks contract-based or legally required processing.
- **Declarations to the BA** are not our consents: the Jobbörse choice (TL 407 field 50) is
  stored as an enum on the profiling record, and the BA contact/research consent as a boolean,
  each with a date. Revocation goes to the BA.

## Retention and deletion *(verify, Q3, Q24, Q40, Q51, Q52)*

**Each data item or document follows its own retention class.** Where one item falls under
several rules, the longest of those rules applies. Retention is **per item, never per person**,
so a long payroll rule never keeps a whole profile.

| Data | Retention (from) |
|---|---|
| Unmatched / rejected self-registrations | 30 days |
| Non-signers (`withdrawn` pre-TG) without BA-funded measures | full deletion 90 days after the signing deadline (the grace period ends with `withdrawn`) |
| Non-signers with BA-funded §110 measures | full deletion after 90 days, **except the evidence set** |
| Structured health fields | 3 months after beE exit, or with non-signer deletion |
| Schwerbehinderung status for payroll | with payroll records, as long as payroll needs it |
| TG personnel file, DSV, profiling, placement data | 3 years after the end of the year of exit |
| Sub-status periods (sickness etc.) | payroll retention |
| Lohnkonto | end of the 6th calendar year after the last entry (§41 EStG) |
| Entgeltunterlagen | end of the calendar year after the last social-security audit (§28f SGB IV) |
| Accounting vouchers | 8 years (BEG IV); books and annual statements 10 years |
| ESF-funded projects (later) | per funding notice, configurable |
| Audit log | 3 years; pseudonymise subject references when the subject's data is deleted |

**Evidence set** (for anyone who took part in a BA-funded §110 measure or received
Transfer-KuG): identity, measure, dates and times of participation, signed participation pages
(TL 407, Kug 200b), proof of submission, and the matching audit entries.
- It expires at the end of the calendar year of the **later** of `kugFinalSettlementDate` and
  `measure110SettlementDate`, plus 4 years (configurable, must be verified).
- It is **not deleted until the required settlement dates are set**. The admin dashboard warns
  when a project ended more than 12 months ago without them.
- Access is break-glass only.

Implementation:
- `retentionClass` per data category and document type, configured as data.
- A nightly, idempotent, **two-stage job** with the `system` actor: full deletion first, then
  evidence-set deletion.
- **Backups are kept for at most 30 days**, so that deletions take effect.
- All periods are configurable and must be confirmed by the DPO and tax advisor before the
  pilot.

## Authentication *(assumed, Q7, Q11, Q27, Q28)*

- **Staff**: Entra ID via OIDC, MFA enforced by Conditional Access. Roles and assignments are
  managed in the app. Sessions last 8 hours, server-side, in httpOnly SameSite cookies.
- **Participants**:
  - The mobile number is the primary channel (SMS link or code). Private email is secondary.
    **Imported work emails are never used for login.**
  - Links/codes are single-use and expire after 15 minutes, with at most 5 requests per hour
    per phone number or email.
  - Sessions: 30 minutes idle, 12 hours absolute.
  - Before special-category data is shown, the participant must enter their date of birth as a
    knowledge check. A real second factor comes later.
  - Fallbacks: a printable one-time access code (info events), and assisted mode.
- **Assisted mode**: staff act on behalf of the participant, audited as `actor` + `onBehalfOf`.
  No session sharing.
- **Self-registration**: only via a project-specific QR code, valid 14 days, rate-limited, with
  a captcha. Matched manually by the PL.

## Other rules

1. **Purpose limitation per phase.** The UI explains each purpose to the participant.
2. **Audit log** for every read of special-category and highly confidential data, every
   document opening, every export, every break-glass, every guard override, and every confirmed
   plausibility warning.
3. **Hosting**: local for development on synthetic data only. Production and the pilot run on
   the company Hetzner cluster in German locations only (ADR-0005). Real data never goes on
   laptops, into cloud coding sessions or into the repo.
4. **No AI in the MVP.** Later, only EU-hosted providers with an AVV and no training on our
   data. US providers are never used for personal data, even with a contract *(assumed, Q38)*.
   Check the EU AI Act classification before any assessment feature.
5. **No real data in development, tests, cloud coding sessions or screenshots.** Synthetic data
   only (`pnpm db:seed`, `fixtures/`).
6. **Logs, error reports and job payloads contain no personal data.** Use IDs only.
7. **Uploads**: virus scan (adapter), file-type allowlist, size limit, stored outside the web
   root, signed short-lived URLs.
8. **Participant rights**: export of own data and deletion requests (admin workflow in the MVP),
   subject to the retention duties above.
9. **Exports**: no Steuer-ID, SV-Nummer or IBAN in the payroll export unless back office
   explicitly requests it. That request is logged.
10. **DPIA (DSFA)** must be completed before any real data is used (Q25).
